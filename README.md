Submitted by: **Lashaun Baddol**

**Sea monster crowdfunding** is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: **72** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [/ ] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [/ ] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [/ ] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [/ ] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [I improved the look and feel of the website by adding improved hover effects to buttons and containers ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
* [I added the ability to switch between a night mode and a light mode which only really changes the color skeem of the website] 
* [I added a search bar with the abbility to accept an input and open a side panel with a list of all games ] 
* [I wanted to add a glassmorphism effect to the website but didn't really know where so i created a new section that basically shouts out donors and how much they donated through an automated slider ] 
[I added animation to a few eliments in the website and made the top two games play videos on hover ]
* [Last thing I added was footer which is just a picture of a moon covered by a gradient and then above that I added a moving fog img ] 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented features:
